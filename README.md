      ```cmd
        > yarn
      ```
      
    - npm
      
      ```cmd
        > npm install
      ```
      
    **Note** :  This application needs [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel to make it available globally .If you don't have one it automatically downloads one .
    
 ## How to
  
   - Run start script with [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) .
    
     - Yarn
    
        ```cmd
          > yarn start
        ```
      
      - npm
      
        ```cmd
          > npm run start
        ```
        
  - Now use ngrok to tunnel the tcp protocol as below.
    ```cmd
      > ngrok tcp 8080
    ```

  - Now from client side connect using telnet (or) nc then the data written in story.txt will be emitted to client line by line with 2 seconds delay. (If using a mobile as client download a Simple Socker Server application)
